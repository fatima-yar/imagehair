Welcome to our project development project! Our team of three is excited to share our journey in creating a stunning online presence for a hairdresser salon. We're passionate about delivering a top-notch website that meets the salon's needs and exceeds their expectations.

## Project Overview
Our approach began with a planning phase, where we consulted with the salon team to understand their requirements and preferences. We asked questions, listened attentively, and took notes to ensure we captured their vision. With their input, we started designing components and interfaces tailored to their needs.

## Design and Prototyping
We utilized [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/wqZ5bYiVh69Apop9lk6wiE/Image-Hair---V1?node-id=43-417&t=UifYyYsPrDxR7VeE-0) for designing and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGKB5AuSTw/yTV9Y4Y7-rx7fTa-5HPC2g/edit?) for breaking down each component, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design. Our design process involved creating wireframes, mockups, and high-fidelity prototypes to bring the salon's vision to life.

## Technical Implementation
After finalizing the design, we chose Astro as our front-end framework, paired with Tailwind CSS, to build the website. We were drawn to Astro's benefits, including its speed, scalability, and ease of use. We created a GitHub repository and managed our project using [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/fatima-yar/projects/1), where we tracked progress, assigned tasks, and collaborated on code changes.

## Development
With Astro and Tailwind set up, we began building individual UI components, which we then combined to create pages. We employed JSON for mapping services, resulting in an amazing outcome. Throughout the development process, we ensured responsiveness, accessibility, and a seamless user experience. Our website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Outcome
Our hard work and dedication have culminated in a stunning, fully responsive website that showcases the hairdresser salon's services, style, and charm. We're proud of our collaboration and the final product
